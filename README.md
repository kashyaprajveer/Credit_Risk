# Credit_Risk Analysis
This repository Contains in-detailed analysis for credit risk which includes Exploratory data analysis of the dataset followed by comparision of different models for the prediction task. I have tried to exclusively check the effect of pre-procession on the model prediction such as normalization, class balancing etc. 

For categorical features I have used One-hot encoding for now in future will add other options as well to evaluate further improvement.

Model currently compared:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) SVM
5) Neural Network
6) Catboost
